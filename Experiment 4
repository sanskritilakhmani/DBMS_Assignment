OBJECTIVE: To implement the concept of aggregating & grouping of Data.
Theory:
Group Functions: 
Group functions operate on set of rows, result is based on group of rows rather than one result 
per row as returned by single row functions.
1)Avg    return average value of n
Syntax:
Avg ([distinct/all] n)
2)Min    return minimum value of expr.
Syntax:
MIN([distinct/all] expr)
3) Count  Returns the no of rows where expr is not null
Syntax:
Count ([distinct/all] expr)
Count (*)   Returns the no rows in the table, including duplicates and those with nulls.
4)Max     Return max value of expr
Syntax:
Max ([distinct/all]expr)
5) Sum     Returns sum of values of n
Syntax:
Sum ([distinct/all]n) 
Example Queries:
Aggregate Functions Examples:
select AVG(GPA) as “Average GPA” from student;
Average GPA
-----------------3.56666667
Select AVG(DISTINCT GPA) as “Distinct GPA” from student
Distinct GPA
------------3.54285714
Select MIN(GPA) as “Minimum GPA” from student
Minimum GPA
-----------------2.9
Select COUNT(*) from student
COUNT(*)
----------12
Select COUNT(sName) from student
COUNT(SNAME)
------------12
select COUNT(distinct sName) from student
COUNT(DISTINCTSNAME)
-------------------------------------10
Select MAX(GPA) from student
MAX(GPA)
---------3.9
Select SUM(GPA) from student
SUM(GPA)
----------42.8
Q.Find average GPA without using Average function.
Select SUM(GPA)/COUNT(GPA) as “Average” from student
Average
----------3.56666667
Grouping Data From Tables:
There are circumstances where we would like to apply the aggregate function not only to a 
single set of tuples, but also to a group of sets of tuples, we specify this wish in SQL using the 
group by clause. The attribute or attributes given in the group by  clause are used to form group. 
Tuples with the same value on all attributes in the group by clause are placed in one group.
Syntax:
SELECT columnname, columnname
FROM  tablename
GROUP BY columnname;
HAVING clause:
The  HAVING  clause  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  GROUP  BY  clause.  HAVING 
imposes  a condition on the GROUP BY clause, this further filters the groups created by the 
GROUP BY clause. 
HAVING clause can be used to find duplicates in a relation or in other words find unique values 
in the situations where DISTINCT cannot apply.
NOTE:  Each  column  specifications  specified  in  HAVING  clause  must  occur  in  the  list  of 
columns named in the GROUP BY clause.
Example
1. select state, count(cname) from college GROUP BY state;
STATE COUNT(CNAME)
----------   ------------CA 2
MA 1
NY 1
2. select state, count(cname) from college GROUP BY state having count(cname)>1;
STATE COUNT(CNAME)
----------   ------------------------CA    2
